## Problem Statement

WAP in C to create the following data structure: Dancing Links

## Data Structure

It is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. 

### Array

Array is a linear data structure where all elements are arranged sequentially.

### Pointers

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Instead of holding a direct value, it holds the address where the value is stored in memory. It is the backbone of low-level memory manipulation in C.

### Structures

In C, a structure is a user-defined data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type. The struct keyword is used to define a structure. The items in the structure are called its members and they can be of any valid data type. Applications of structures involve creating data structures Linked List and Tree.

### Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure used for storing a sequence of elements, where each element is stored in a node that contains both the element and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

### Tree

It is a non-linear hierarchical data structure, where there is a single root node and every other node contains a parent and/or child. Linear data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, and linked list can be traversed in only one way. But a hierarchical data structure like a tree can be traversed in different ways.

### Sparse Matrix

A matrix is a two-dimensional data object made of m rows and n columns, therefore having total m x n values. If most of the elements of the matrix have 0 value, then it is called a sparse matrix.

### Circular Linked List

In Circular Singly Linked List, each node has just one pointer called the "next" pointer. The next pointer of the last node points back to the first node and this results in forming a circle. In this type of Linked list, we can only move through the list in one direction.

### Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains 3 parts, a data part and two addresses, one points to the previous node and one for the next node. It differs from the singly linked list as it has an extra pointer called previous that points to the previous node, allowing the traversal in both forward and backward directions.

### Circular Doubly Linked List

A circular doubly linked list is defined as a circular linked list in which each node has two links connecting it to the previous node and the next node.

## Dancing Links

Dancing Links is a technique to add or delete a node from a circular doubly linked list. It is particularly used to implement effective backtracking algorithms, such as Knuth's Algorithm X and the Exact Cover problem.
