## Problem Statement

WAP in C to create the following data structure: Dancing Links

## Data Structure

It is the organization of data needed to solve the problem.

### Array

It is a linear data-structure, where data is stored **sequentially**.

### Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are **not** stored at contiguous memory locations. In other words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

### Stack

Stack is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed in LIFO(Last In First Out) order. The elements are visualized to be stored as ‘on-top’ of each other. They are used in calculator operations, evaluating expressions, and in microprocessors.

### Queue

Queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed in FIFO(First In First Out) order. The elements are visualized to be stored as ‘after’ each other. They are used in task scheduling, queuing operations, etc.

### Tree

It is a non-linear hierarchical data structure, where there is a single root node and every other node contains a parent and/or child. Linear data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, and linked list can be traversed in only one way. But a hierarchical data structure like a tree can be traversed in different ways.
